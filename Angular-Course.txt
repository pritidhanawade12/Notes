node : used by CLI in background to bundle and optimise angular application
npm- node package manager - to manage external dependencies(libary needed in application) for angular application.

install angular : nmp install -g @angular/cli@latest
create app : ng new my-dream-app

Package.json - contains all dependencies of angular application , 3rd party packages that needs to run project correctly.
		eg. http , forms ,router, animations, platform-browser-dynamic etc.
		contains dev dependencies only required for developement.  eg. typescript , jasmine-karma , angular-cli etc.

e2e- end to end testing

node modules - all the dependencies we see in package.json are actually installed inside node module folder.


src: folders{app , assets , environments},files{ favicon.io , index.html,main.ts , styles.scss , polyfills.ts , test.ts} etc.

app.module.ts - tells angular which pieces belong to angular application.

bootstrap:[AppComponent] - basically lists all the components which should be known to angular at the time when angular analyses index.html(when angular starts whole application).

Errors occured:
mentioned in bootstrap array and selector not given in index.html --> <app-root> didnt match any element.
bootstrap:[ ] -->empty array but selector given in index.html --> @NgModule.bootstrap does not have any component / nor ngDoBootstrap method

Component - 
component is simple typescript class so that angular is able instantiate it to create objects based on blueprint we setup.

Decorator:Decorator is a typescript feature which allow you to enhance your classes , enhance elements we use in our code.

Modules: angular uses modules to bundle different components of an app into packages.
	Modules bundles funtionalities in an app , it gives information to angular which features current application has.
	It is a class with @NgModule decorator.This decorator has 4 properties ...
	declarations:[]--> lists all the components created inside the current module
	imports :[]--> allows us to add modules to current module which are required to run application
	providers:[]
	bootstrap:[]-->asically lists all the components which should be known to angular at the time when angular analyses index.html(when angular starts 			whole application).
		
BrowserModule--> gives all the base functionlity we need to start an application
